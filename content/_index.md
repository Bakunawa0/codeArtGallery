## where am i what do i do
Under _gallery_ you'll find the art I have done. Under _ramblings_ you'll find a place where I might talk about stuff... occasionally... eventually.
Don't expect much activity in _ramblings_, or at least much less than in _gallery_. Under _in memoriam_ you'll find a screenshot of the old site design,
in it's **handwritten HTML** fugliness. I want to preserve that part of the site's history. Click the motto: **"Let Computers Draw"** to head back to this 
page from anywhere on the site.

Anyway, do have a good look around and just _O B S E R V E_ for a while.
