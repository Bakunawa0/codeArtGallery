After like, 5 months of not really doing anything with this site *(thank the 2nd semester for that)* I have migrated the site!

This site has always been bouncing around, but I think I will definitely stay with github pages, at least until I can pay for
webhosting.

While netlify seemed pretty cool -- and for a while it was -- it expired sometime late January. Can't have that. At least github
lets me live on the web rent-free.
