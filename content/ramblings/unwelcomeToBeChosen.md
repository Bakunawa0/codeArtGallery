Forgive the "Hunger Games" reference, but "Unwelcome" really is going to be selected as my best artwork!

It's for the Mimesis art club which I am currently a member of. I am also the one doing the selecting, so it isn't really all that impressive
at the end of the day. Regardless, I am still the only member of the club who does this sort of thing, so I'll definitely stand out from the 
crowd. This is also what prompted me to work on this site again, since I noticed the old one had gone offline, which would make submitting the art difficult. Well, at least I am working on *something* this summer.
